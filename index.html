       <p> When I Was living In El Kef City I didn't tried to work many things But i tried one time to work in a Kiosk Point 
           <br>And Really I didn't did that because i Need Money Just to feel what people feel with that type of Job 
           <br>But In that time I learnt many things like how to work with teams , communicate with people and accept many point of views and in the end we make a deal that all people accept it
           <br>But after one year i moved to Paris And i stopped Doing anything Here in Tunisia So i Started working in a kebab restaurant there and i tried to work in a library 
           <br>really this Experiences was really great because i learnt the meaning of feeling and contacts of energy between humans how it works 
           <Br> And now really im happy for what iam doing like studying In the IFT and With GoMyCode At the same time waiting for some months to end for Going Back To Paris !
